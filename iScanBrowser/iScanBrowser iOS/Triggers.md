# Triggers

iScanBrowser triggers allow you to map a specific button (either in the floating taskbar or floating) to trigger a read action to the associated barcode scanner, RFID scanner, or UniMag reader. The floating trigger can also be assigned to trigger a read from the iOS CoreNFC reader.

To access iScanBrowser's trigger settings, navigate to iScanBrowser's settings page by tapping on the gear icon located on the floating task bar.

# Triggers

iScanBrowser triggers allow you to map a specific button (either in the floating taskbar or floating) to trigger a read action to the associated barcode scanner, RFID scanner, or UniMag reader. The floating trigger can also be assigned to trigger a read from the iOS CoreNFC reader.

To access iScanBrowser's trigger settings, navigate to iScanBrowser's settings page by tapping on the gear icon located on the floating task bar.

## About the Triggers

### Trigger #1 — RFID
Trigger #1 can be assigned to any paired **RFID scanner**. When the trigger button is tapped, it will trigger the RFID reader to attempt to read nearby tags.

### Trigger #2 — Barcode
Trigger #2 can be assigned to any paired **barcode scanner**. When the trigger button is tapped, it will trigger the barcode scanner to emit its laser (read a barcode).

### Floating Trigger — Any

The floating trigger (named as such because it is displayed as a floating, draggable button) can be assigned to
- Any paired barcode scanner
- Any paired RFID scanner
- Compatible UniMag readers
- The native CoreNFC NDEF reader (supported iPhone/iPad models only)

## Trigger Locations
Trigger #1 and Trigger #2 are located on the floating task bar (when enabled) and the floating trigger — aptly named — is a floating button. Note that the floating trigger is only visible when it is enabled and associated with a device or the native NFC reader.

## Enable Duplicate Scans After Pre-defined Time Interval
To prevent iScanBrowser from posting duplicate scans _until a specified time has passed_, tap on the option labeled "**See new after (secs)**."

One second is the default value (this effectively always posts duplicates scans). To change the value, type in the number of seconds you want iScanBrowser to wait before seeing a duplicate scan value as new. Here we've set the time interval to _30 seconds_.

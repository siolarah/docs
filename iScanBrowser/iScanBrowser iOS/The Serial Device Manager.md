# The Serial Device Manager (SDM)


This document provides information and instruction related to using the Serial Device Manager (SDM) for iOS, which is built into iScanBrowser.


You can access the SDM by tapping on the SDM icon from the floating taskbar.

## Pair with a Bluetooth Device
The main page of the Serial Device Manager is where you'll be able to pair with, manage, and disconnect from your Bluetooth devices.

Scanners in HID mode (already paired with in iOS Bluetooth Settings) will appear beneath "**CONNECTED DEVICES**," scanners in MFi mode, will appear in the section labeled "**MFi DEVICES**," and scanners in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) mode will appear beneath "**BLUETOOTH LE DEVICES**."

The Scanfob 2006 in the screenshot below is in BLE mode and appears in the BLUETOOTH LE DEVICES section.

## Device Settings
To access a paired device's settings, tap on the gear icon to the far right of the device's Bluetooth name.

The settings available vary by the type of device and the Bluetooth connection type , but generally you'll have access to some basic information about the device (such as the model number, Bluetooth name, or serial number) and a handful of device settings options (as shown below).

### Enable the Device Filter

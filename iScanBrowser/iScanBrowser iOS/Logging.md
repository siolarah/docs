Enter your **name** (so we know who to associate the log or bug report with) and the **password for log uploading**. 

You can get the log password from the Serialio representative you're working with. 

If you aren't currently working with a Serialio representative, email us at support@serialio.com with a detailed report of the problem at hand, the type of device (for example, iPhone 7 or iPad Air 1), and any other information relevant to the problem that could help us fix it.
